This semester concludes the end of my 2-year stay with Tembusu College. It has been a place where I have made many good memories, and I will certainly miss my time here. Having started my undergrad research project, I finally got around to learning Latex and used it for typing out homework as well. Some other interesting modules I took this semester are:

### CS4268 Quantum Computing

I was always interested in quantum physics and computing but never really understood how quantum computers worked despite watching numerous videos. Indeed, it is difficult to explain the intuition in a subject like this without diving into the mathematics. As such, I was really glad to have completed this module early. The module started with a recap of some linear algebra and notation, followed by toy algorithms like Deutschâ€“Jozsa and Simon's algorithm. The difficulty quickly ramped up as we got into phase estimation, Shor's algorithm for factoring, and continued fractions. There was also a project worth 10% of the final grade, but the project was mostly a light coding exercise, although still a good exposure to Qiskit. Assignments were graded and difficult, and some of the questions in the exams are genuinely difficult to solve in a timed setting no matter how much you studied the content.

Expected Grade: A-, Actual Grade: A

### CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This module was about designing and proving the correctness and runtime of algorithms. The main textbook was CLRS which I finally found a good excuse to finally read page by page. I enjoyed the programming assignments, and while I did well in the midterms, the finals was only 4 questions which were all hit-or-miss, which made me readjust my grade expectations. The module's content was not a lot more or harder than CS2040S, but some of the written assignments were extremely difficult for many people to solve.

Expected grade: A-/A, Actual Grade: A-

### UTC2101

As my final Tembusu module, Time & Life did not disappoint. This module was sometimes philosophical, and other times science-y regarding the invention of time-tracking devices, sleep and work-life balance. The module also had a project which could be pretty much any form you want which was great. I put up a typing speed game to showcase the negative effects of rushing for time. I don't usually score well for modules that require writing, so I am not expecting a high grade here. I would highly recommend this to all my Tembusu juniors, although it is quite competitive to get.

Expected Grade: B+/A-, Actual Grade: B+

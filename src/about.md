Hi there! My name is Yitao. Its currently my 3rd year studying computer science at NUS. I enjoy solving problems, building and learning new stuff.
I'm interested in many topics, including algorithms (classical, quantum and ML), software engineering and distributed computing.

In my free time, I like watching sci-fi movies, playing chess and fingerstyle guitar. I also like a bit of exercise through
running, cycling and playing floorball.

If you have any feedback, feel free to reach out to me at [sunyitao7@gmail.com](mailto:sunyitao7@gmail.com)
